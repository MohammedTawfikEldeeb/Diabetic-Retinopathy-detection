# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

This project focuses on detecting **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** using **Deep Learning** techniques. DR is a serious eye condition caused by diabetes, which can lead to blindness if not detected early. The goal of this project is to classify retinal images based on the severity of DR using **EfficientNet**, a powerful and efficient convolutional neural network architecture.

## üîç Key Features
- **Two Implementations**: Available in both **TensorFlow/Keras** and **PyTorch**.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **98.4%** accuracy on the test dataset.
- **EfficientNet-based Model**: Uses EfficientNet for accurate and efficient DR classification.
- **Preprocessing & Augmentation**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment Ready**: Can be integrated into a **Streamlit app** for easy real-world use.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset consists of **retinal fundus images** labeled according to the severity of DR. It is sourced from **[Kaggle's Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection)**.

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **PyTorch**
- **EfficientNet**
